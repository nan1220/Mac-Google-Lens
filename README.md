Locally customized code to quickly upload and search for image from clipboard, file and link


***[main motivation and inspiration source](https://github.com/roma160/Windows-Google-Lens/blob/master/README.md)***


***Guided and rescued by:[GOD](https://github.com/roma160)***
(also thank u very much!)


Target user: **ONLY ME** (if just according to the original code)


(if anyone else wants to use it, the customized chrome profile user date must also be customized. Not a big deal ; I'll briefly write the way in the following part.)




## Clipboard Search



## File Search



## Link Search







# Customize the chrome user profile
this is the path for the user info:

***chrome://version/***


Find the ***Profile Path***and then replace mine with it.
